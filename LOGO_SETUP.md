# UTRONIX Logo Setup

## Instructions

To complete the header setup, please follow these steps:

1. **Place your UTRONIX logo PNG file** in the `public/` directory
2. **Name the file exactly**: `utronix-logo.png`
3. **Recommended specifications**:
   - Format: PNG
   - Size: At least 200x200px (higher resolution is better)
   - Background: Transparent preferred
   - File name: `utronix-logo.png`

## What's Updated

✅ **Header Component**: Updated to use the PNG logo instead of text
✅ **Fallback**: If the logo file is missing, it will show "UTRONIX" text as backup
✅ **Clean Design**: Only shows "Order Management System" text alongside the logo
✅ **Responsive**: Logo scales properly on all screen sizes

## File Location

```
public/
└── utronix-logo.png  ← Place your logo file here
```

Once you place the logo file, the header will automatically display it across all three dashboards (Customer, Supplier, and Admin).
